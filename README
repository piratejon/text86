This incarnation of text86 is not meant to share the flash drive with other
purposes and destructively overwrites the master boot record and partition
table and several bytes after these.

make && dd if=text86 of=/dev/your/flash/drive

For example, my flash drive on this computer is /dev/sdb, so I do this:

make && sudo dd if=text86 of=/dev/sdb
      _______
     f       \
     | Usage | 
     \_______j
After installing per the above, just boot your computer to the flash drive and
start typing. It's really that simple. Press Ctrl+S to save early and often.
There is no autosave or intelligent recovery of any sort. Anything not saved
at power-off is effectively lost. Text is save in 512-byte sectors. When you
save, power off, and boot back up, only the text from the most recent 512-byte
sector is put on the screen to remind you where you left off, but the rest of
the text is probably still there, honest! When you're finished, do a final
save to be certain then power off.

Use keymap.py to set the keyboard layout in the file called keymap. Then run
make and dd as above. rm keymap && make to get qwerty back.

* Start the cursor at the correct end-of-text on restore
* Make a keystroke that reboots (after saving, of course)
* Word count, either ongoing or at save
* You there! Add your preferred keymap!
